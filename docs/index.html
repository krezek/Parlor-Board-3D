				<h3>Parlor Board 3D</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It is a popular German game in which each player has four characters who are moved at once around the field towards the goal.</li>
					<li>Everyone must try to get the four characters to the end first, eliminating opponents along the way until they have to start over.</li>
					<li>The original game is "Mensch ärgere Dich nicht", Developed by Josef Friedrich Schmidt in 1907/1908.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Regeln</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The game has a very simple set of rules through which players can quickly follow and play the game.</li>
					<li>Each player has 4 pieces that must move around the 40 steps of the board before reaching their safe destination.</li>
					<li>Players roll a 6-sided die that determines how many steps they can move a piece each turn.</li>
					<li>The player must roll a 6 before the piece starts moving around the board.</li>
					<li>Any time a player rolls a number that means his or her piece lands on top of another player's piece, the opponent's piece is sent to the start of the game.</li>
					<li>The first player to send all four of his pieces to the end is the winner.</li>
